
# Requirements:
## 1. Create a sample Hello world c++ project and then create a docker file for this cmake/c++ project

- Manage unit tests with gtest 
- Specify debug and release C/C++ flags using CMake and manage with a CMakeLists.txt 
- Pump out logs and statistics generated by gcovr/lcov. 
 

## 2. Create a CI/CD pipeline to build the docker file from step 1

- Pipeline should have a logic to create release notes from list of Git merge on Master branch. 
- If the unit test cases are successful, publish the image to dockerhub  
- Have a strategy for tagging and branching enabled in the pipeline (Good to have/Optional)
